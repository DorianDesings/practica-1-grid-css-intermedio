              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny’s worth.

              "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
              Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
              easy.

              "Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code.
              I needed some structure of professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. He encouraged me to enroll a former
              student of his who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands on and I never had to wait long for help. The
              agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way no tutorial ever could. In
              fact, I have often referred to him during interviews as an example
              of my development experience, for me he is an example to follow
              both personally and professionally. It certainly helped me get a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommendable!"
